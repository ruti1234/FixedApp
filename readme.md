# Broken Blog App

You are provided with a simple blog application built with Angular (frontend) and .NET Core (backend). 

The application shows list of posts retrieved from the server. When clicking on a post its details are shown below the list.
There is also a simple form to add a new post.

Your task is:
#### - To identify and fix  bad implementations
#### - Improve the code quality
#### - Ensure the application works as expected.
#### No new functionality, logic or features need to be added to the application!!! 

## Project Structure
- `frontend/`: Angular application for the blog (Angular CLI version 16.2.5).
- `backend/`: .NET Core API for the blog.

## Assignment Instructions
1. Set up both the frontend and backend according to their respective `README.md` files.
2. Identify poor practices in the code and refactor where necessary (e.g., hardcoded values, lack of modularity, error handling,  poor naming conventions).
 (both frontend and backend).
3.Add basic validation to the "Create Blog Post" form (e.g., Title and Content should not be empty).
Ensure API input validation is properly handled on the backend.
4. Submit your updated code along with a document outlining the changes you made.

## Deliverables
Provide a short document (or update the README) with:
1. A list of the issues you identified.
	What changes you made and why.
2.  Submit the updated code  in separate repo (with the link)

## Prerequisites
- Node.js and Angular CLI for the frontend.
- .NET SDK for the backend.
