# Broken Blog App

You are provided with a simple blog application built with Angular (frontend) and .NET Core (backend). 
The application shows list of posts that are stored in the server. When clicking on a post its details are shown below the list.
There is also a form to add a new post.
Your task is to identify and fix bad implementations, improve the code quality, and ensure the application works as expected.
### No new functionality, logic or features need to be added!!! 

## Project Structure
- `frontend/`: Angular application for the blog.
- `backend/`: .NET Core API for the blog.

## Assignment Instructions
1. Set up both the frontend and backend according to their respective `README.md` files.
2. Identify poor practices in the code and refactor where necessary (e.g., hardcoded values, lack of modularity, error handling,  poor naming conventions).
 (both frontend and backend).
3.Add basic validation to the "Create Blog Post" form (e.g., Title and Content should not be empty).
Ensure API input validation is properly handled on the backend.
4. Submit your updated code along with a document outlining the changes you made.

## Deliverables
Provide a short document (or update the README) with:
1. A list of the issues you identified.
	What changes you made and why.
2. Submit the updated code  in separate branch

## Prerequisites
- Node.js and Angular CLI for the frontend.
- .NET SDK for the backend.
